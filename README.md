# BookSharing Android App

Book Sharing is an Android Application that has been created to provide a solution to the students who want to borrow books from other students either from their batch or from a senior batch. 

The app allows students to post images of the books by storing them in **Firebase Storage** and downloaded using **Picasso** library along with the title of the book they are willing to lend and other students can comment to request the book. Students can also view all other students of the batch and can follow them to see their posts

Authentication is acheived by **Firebase Auth** and data is stored in **Firebase Cloud Database**

Developed using Java, XML and Firebase and app contains multiple Activities and Fragments.
